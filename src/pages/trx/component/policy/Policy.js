        Chapter 1 Definition
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        Presale definition: refers to a sales model in which a merchant provides
        a product or service plan, gathers consumer orders through presale
        product tools, and provides goods and / or services to consumers
        according to prior agreement.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        The presale model is a "deposit" model. "Deposit" refers to a fixed
        amount of presale commodity price pre-delivered. “The deposit” can
        participate in small games and have the opportunity to win more
        deposits. The deposit can be directly exchanged for commodities. The
        deposit is not redeemable.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        Presale products: refers to the products released by merchants using
        presale product tools. Only the presale words are marked on the product
        title or product details page, and the products that do not use the
        presale product tools are not presale products. Presale system: Refers
        to the system product tools provided to support merchants for presale
        model sales.

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        Presale commodity price: refers to the selling price of presale
        commodity. The price of presale goods is composed of two parts: deposit
        and final payment. Presale deposit: Refers to a certain amount of money
        that consumers pay in advance when purchasing presale goods, which is
        mainly used as a guarantee to purchase presale goods and determine the
        purchase quota.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        Presale final payment: refers to the amount of money that the consumer
        still has to pay after the presale commodity price minus the deposit.

        2.1.4 To avoid unnecessary disputes, If the presale product is a

        the product page of the production cycle and delivery time of the
        product, and contact the consumer to confirm the delivery standard,

        Mall transaction mode
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        There are two ways to buy in the mall, one is full purchase, and the
        other is deposit purchase. In the mode of full purchase, you can place
        an order directly and purchase goods in full payment.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        The deposit purchase mode will freeze the customer's deposit, and the
        customer will take delivery after completing the final payment within 7
        days. Users who have paid a deposit will be given an extra point quiz
        game. According to the analysis of market fluctuations, they have the
        opportunity to win more points to deduct the payment or send red
        envelopes to friends.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        The pre-order model has many benefits for customers. The deposit not
        only generates an order for the customer, but also gives the customer an
        equal amount of red envelopes, which can be withdrawn immediately.
        Although the deposit is not refundable, the red envelope converted from
        the deposit can be withdrawn without any loss to the customer.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        After the customer pays the deposit and orders, a merchandise order is
        generated, and the mall began to prepare this order. This deposit cannot
        be returned. After the customer needs to make up the balance, the mall
        will ship the goods. If the customer does not make up the balance, the
        product order will always exist.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        After paying the deposit, the customer will be given a red envelope
        account with the same amount of deposit.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        1. The red envelope can be withdrawn directly, so that instead of losing
        money, the customer has added a commodity order generated by a deposit.
        And red envelopes can also be given to friends.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "white !important" }}>
        2. If the customer uses the red envelope account to participate in the
        game, you can earn more red envelopes, but if the game loses, the red
        envelope will be gone, but his merchandise order is still there.
